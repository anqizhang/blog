## Overview

[Markdown.app](https://markdown.app) is a free software, which is base on [MarkEditor](https://www.markeditor.com).

In another way, `Markdown.app` is a lite version of **MarkEditor**.
If you want to get a much much more powerful tool, try **MarkEditor**. But if you just need an APP to edit a markdown document, `Markdown.app` is good enough.

## Different to MarkEditor

**MarkEditor** is 10+ times powerful than `Markdown.app`.
`Markdown.app` is focused on `writing in Markdown`, and **MarkEditor** is focused on `writing & productiveness`.

By the way, to keep the compatibility between **MarkEditor**  and `Markdown.app`, they are using the same UI for **App Preferences**. Some configs you can see in `Markdown.app`, only working in **MarkEditor** in fact.

## Features for Markdown.app

- Markdown syntax auto highlight

## Notes

As a **free software**,  `Markdown.app` does not accept any feature requests, and is without any kind of warranty.
